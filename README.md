# Design Choises

* Fonts:
  
  I will use the font [LATO](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) as it  a very simple style which provides the easiest
   nature of the overall site design.
   
    The focus of the content is to provide an informative experience for the customer,
     so i think this is the right font for my project.
* Icons:
  The icons used are self explanatory , so easy for users to interpret what the icon will actually do. 
  I use the icon ‘bars’ from font-awesome icons.
 I had to make sure that the icon was perfect size on smaller devices to ensure easy access.

* Colours:
   * Primary: #DA17B7 "Steel Pink"
 rgb ( 233, 122, 183 )


* Background:
 * Images:
  
   I used real pictures of my work converted with [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)
