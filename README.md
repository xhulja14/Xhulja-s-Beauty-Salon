# User Requirements and Expectations

  * __Requirements__:


   * Navigate the website using the navbar which should be clear and hierarchical.
  
   * Be provided with information of different services of the salon.

   * Contact Form validation to help against spam.







  * __Expextations__:

  * Content is visually satisfying and informative.
  
  * Navigation takes user to specific parts of the website.

  * Form Validation works correctly.


# Design Choises

* __Fonts__:
  
  I will use the font [LATO](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) as it  a very simple style which provides the easiest
   nature of the overall site design.
   
    The focus of the content is to provide an informative experience for the customer,
     so i think this is the right font for my project.

* __Icons__:
  
  The icons used are self explanatory , so easy for users to interpret what the icon will actually do. 
  I use the icon ‘bars’ from font-awesome icons.
 I had to make sure that the icon was perfect size on smaller devices to ensure easy access.

* __Colours__:
  
   Pink colour is a delicate color that means sweet, nice, 
   playful, cute, romantic, charming, and tenderness,
    is associated with flowers, and sweetness. 
    I think is best  colour for beauty salon websites.

   * Primary: #DA17B7 "__Steel Pink__" i chose this as primary colour because i think
   is perfect for influencing cuteness and charm.

   * Secondary: #FD6C9E "__French Pink__" this colour is kind and comforting, full of sympathy and compattion,
  makes us feel accepted, perfect feeling for clients.
 
   * Navigation colour: #BC00DD "__Electric Purple__" The color purple is often associated with royalty, nobility, luxury, power, and ambition.
   Purple also represents meanings of wealth, extravagance, creativity, wisdom, dignity,  peace, mystery, independence, and magic.

   * Default Background colour: #FADDE1 "__Pale Pink__" Pink shades are believed to bring about serenity, relaxation, acceptance, and contentment, 
   as well to neutralize disorder or soften frustration.

* __Background__:
  
  The images i used for background are real pictures made in my work,
  because i think is good way of showing to clients what we offer.


 * __Images__:
  
   I used real pictures of my work converted with [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)


## Wireframes:

I built Wireframes using [Balsamiq Wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/?gclid=Cj0KCQjwl4v4BRDaARIsAFjATPlYpXIjRR0-L308Af_Usr5Zz7_AO_kIghwLibynrZZY548o6rkIqbcaAt6NEALw_wcB).  
It was very simple design just to get the idea how is going to look the structure of the page in different devices.
