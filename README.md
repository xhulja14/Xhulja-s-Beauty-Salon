# Design Choises

* Fonts:
  
  I will use the font [LATO](http://www.latofonts.com/lato-free-fonts/) as it  a very simple style which provides the easiest
   nature of the overall site design.
   
    The focus of the content is to provide an informative experience for the customer,
     so i think this is the right font for my project.
* Icons:
  The icons used are self explanatory , so easy for users to interpret what the icon will actually do. 
  I use the icon ‘bars’ from font-awesome icons.
 I had to make sure that the icon was perfect size on smaller devices to ensure easy access.

* Colours:
  
   Pink colour is a delicate color that means sweet, nice, 
   playful, cute, romantic, charming, and tenderness,
    is associated with flowers, and sweetness. 

   * Primary: #DA17B7 "__Steel Pink__" i chose this as primary colour because i think
   is perfect for influencing cuteness and charm.

   * Secondary: #FD6C9E "__French Pink__" this colour is kind and comforting, full of sympathy and compattion,
  makes us feel accepted, perfect feeling for clients.
 
   * Navigation colour: #BC00DD "__Electric Purple__" The color purple is often associated with royalty, nobility, luxury, power, and ambition.
   Purple also represents meanings of wealth, extravagance, creativity, wisdom, dignity,  peace, mystery, independence, and magic.
   * Default Background colour: #FADDE1 "__Pale Pink__" Pink shades are believed to bring about serenity, relaxation, acceptance, and contentment, 
   as well to neutralize disorder or soften frustration.

* Background:
  
  The images i used for background are real pictures made in my work,
  because i think is good way of showing to clients what we offer.
 * Images:
  
   I used real pictures of my work converted with [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)
